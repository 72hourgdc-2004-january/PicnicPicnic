     * What is PicnicPicnic?
     *******************************************

        The PicnicPicnic DEMO, is a lite version of the may-be-developed PicnicPicnic game.
        This demo was developed as a team effort by Team P.I.E (above), and was an entry to the
        first 72 hour game programming competition held in 2004.

        The goal of this game is to get your color face to eat as much food as possible, scoring you points.
        However, spiders will make you loose all your points if swallowed, so watch out!
        To control the game you need a 2 button mouse, button 1 for placing and rotating arrows
        for the entitys to move on and button 2 for removing them, you only get to place 4 tiles
        at a time so tile management is essential.
